  scripts they break packaging of APK files.
*** build-project ***
* Change order of checks in DetectBuildAutomationSystemType():
  from: qmake --> cmake --> autotools --> unknown
  to:   cmake --> autotools --> qmake --> unknown

  target ('download') use them all sequentially.
* Update Android NDK version from r12 to r12b.
*** build-project ***

  - delete static libraries only if there are other files besides them
* Update cmake usage in PrepareBuild() after changes in MXE and LXE.
* Change target names scheme for Android builds:
  android-<Android API level>_<target architecture>
  ANDROID_PLATFORM variable from config files will be ignored, because it is
  specified in SYSTEM variable now.
* Change Android application package names scheme:
  <Project name>_android-<Android API level>_<target architecture>.apk
* Add 'install-to-sysroot' (useful for using of extra libraries in android
  program) and 'install-to-qt-sdk' (useful for modules, plugins and libraries
  like qtserialport, qsqlmysql, qca, etc.) command-line options.

  discontinue support of Android SDK, NDK and Qt SDK for 32-bit Linux based
  systems.)
* Add a separate qt-opensource-linux-x64-android-$(QT_VERSION).run file to
  download target.

  SOURCES_DIR      --> BUILD_SERVER_SRC_DIRS
  BUILD_SERVER_DIR --> BUILD_SERVER_BIN_DIR
  BUILD_SERVER_LOG --> BUILD_SERVER_LOG_FILE
* Update GetCurrentVersion():
  - update version format for git projects when there are no git tags
    (--pretty='format:%ad__%h' --date=format-local:'%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')
  - add support of git submodules
    (`git submodule update --init --recursive` is used)
  - add support of projects stored in mercurial repos; date and time based
    version format is used
    (-T '{date(date|localdate,"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")}__{node|short}\n')
  - use date and time based version format for directories which do not use
    version control systems instead of "unknown-version"
    ('+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')
* Improve work with projects containing special characters in paths and/or
  project directory names.
* Delete IsQmakeProject(), IsCmakeProject() and IsAutotoolsProject() functions
  which are not required anymore.
*** build-project ***
* Move InstallUsualProject(), InstallCmakeProject(), InstallAutotoolsProject(),
  InstallQmakeProject() from build-supervisor to build-project.
* Fix InstallCmakeProject() and InstallAutotoolsProject() for cases when
  `make install` is failed.
* Add support of build from paths and directories containing special characters
  (\\\|\$\&\*\(\)\[\]\<\>\ \"\'\`\;:#=). In such cases sources are copied into
  "tmp-sources-dir" subdirectory before build. Also there is special workaround
  for androiddeployqt during building of *.apk files for Android.
* Add support of build of autotools-based projects for Android.
* Fix setting of PROJECT_DIR variable using `realpath` tool.
* Get rid of extra bashisms.
