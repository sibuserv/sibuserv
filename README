Description:
This project includes collection of tools which allows to setup simple build
server based on cross-compilation for target systems. This server will be able
to follow changes in specified git, subversion and/or mercurial repositories
(git-svn and git-remote-hg are supported as well), to make builds and to do
static code analisys (optionally) for each commit in your qmake-, cmake- and/or
autotools-based projects.

Currently supported target systems:
* different GNU/Linux systems (tested for i486, i586, amd64 and armhf)
* MS Windows (tested for i686 and x86_64)
* Android (tested for ARMv7 and x86)
And maybe one day Sibuserv will be able to build C++ apps for OS X too.

This project is not self-contained, it depends on few other projects:
* LXE -- Linux cross-toolchain environment
* MXE -- M cross environment (for MS Windows)
* official Android SDK and NDK
* official Qt SDK (for Android)

Dependencies:
bash, realpath, pkg-config, make, cmake, patch, sed, find, cppcheck
