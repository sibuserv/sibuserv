Description:
This project includes collection of tools which allows to setup simple build
server based on cross-compilation for target systems. This server will be able
to follow changes in specified svn, git-svn and/or git-repositories and to make
builds of your qmake-, cmake- and/or autotools-based projects for each commit. 

Currently supported target systems:
* different GNU/Linux systems (tested for i486, i586, amd64 and armhf)
* MS Windows (i686 and x86_64)
* Android (ARMv5, ARMv7 and x86)
And maybe one day Sibuserv will be able to build C++ apps for OS X too.

This project is not self-contained, it depends on few other projects:
* LXE -- Linux cross-toolchain environment
* MXE -- M cross environment (for MS Windows)
* official Android SDK and NDK
* official Qt SDK (for Android)

Dependencies:
bash, realpath, pkg-config, make, cmake, patch, sed, find, cppcheck
