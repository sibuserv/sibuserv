===== Configuration options =====
Edit ./Makefile if necessary.


===== Installation =====
sudo make install


===== Build environments =====
For downloading of tools for build environments use:
  make linux
  make windows
  make android
  make qt-sdk
or
  make

Downloaded files and unpacked folders should appear in ./opt/ subdirectory.
Copy or move them where you want and use their instructions for setup.


===== Basic configuration files =====
Example of config you may find at ./etc/sibuserv/sibuserv.conf
Just edit and copy it into one of these places:
* /etc/sibuserv/sibuserv.conf
* ${HOME}/.config/sibuserv/sibuserv.conf


===== Examples of building a project =====
Program should be launched in project directory:
  build-project list
  build-project
  build-project AstraLinux-1.2_static
  build-project Ubuntu-14.04-LTS_i386_shared Ubuntu-14.04-LTS_amd64_shared
  build-project install
  build-project install x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared
  build-project clean
  build-project clean AstraLinux-1.2_static i686-w64-mingw32.static
  build-project distclean
  build-project distclean x86_64-w64-mingw32.static
  build-project delete
  build-project delete android-21_x86 android-21_arm
  build-project --version
  build-project --help


===== Examples of launching build server tools =====
Scripts may be launched from any directory:
  build-supervisor
  build-server-daemon &


===== Launching build-server-daemon using systemd =====
Add special user, for example:
  sudo adduser sibuserv

Then set up user privileges in a system (access to files, network, etc.) in
according with "principle of least privilege". For example, write access may be
limited by directories from BUILD_SERVER_SRC_DIRS and BUILD_SERVER_BIN_DIR
config variables.

Next, edit systemd service file ./etc/systemd/build-server-daemon.service if
necessary and copy it into appropriate place:
  sudo cp ./etc/systemd/build-server-daemon.service /lib/systemd/system/

And finally:
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable build-server-daemon
  sudo systemctl restart build-server-daemon

Congratulations! Your build server is ready to use.
